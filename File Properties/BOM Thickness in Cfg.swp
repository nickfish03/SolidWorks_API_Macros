' Note: Original purpose is to create a global variable that is referenced in the 2D drawing that is forced to use decimal units.

' Purpose: To add the global equation "BOM Thickness" as equal to "Thickness"

' Precondition: Have a Part open

' Postcondition: Global variable "BOM Thickness" will have been created in the Equations folder/manager
