# SolidWorks_API_Macros
SolidWorks API Macros that I wrote to speed up drafting of 3D designs

In my job as a Mechanical Drafter using SolidWorks 2021, I modified API macros available on the SolidWorks API help website, as well as various Googled sources.

I use these scripts to speed up the process of taking a 3D model / design, and create a 2D drawing as well as format the file properties for PDM.

I hope making these macros public will help someone else with using SolidWorks more efficiently.
